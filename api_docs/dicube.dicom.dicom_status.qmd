`dicom.dicom_status`



## Classes

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DicomStatus](#dicube.dicom.dicom_status.DicomStatus) | Enumeration of possible DICOM series status conditions. |

### DicomStatus { #dicube.dicom.dicom_status.DicomStatus }

```python
dicom.dicom_status.DicomStatus()
```

Enumeration of possible DICOM series status conditions.

Each status represents a specific condition or issue that may be present
in a DICOM series. The conditions are grouped into categories:
- Series UID Issues
- Instance Number Issues
- Spacing Issues
- Shape Issues
- Orientation Issues
- Data Type Issues
- Location Issues
- Consistency Status

## Functions

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [calculate_average_z_gap](#dicube.dicom.dicom_status.calculate_average_z_gap) | Calculate the average gap between Z-axis locations. |
| [get_dicom_status](#dicube.dicom.dicom_status.get_dicom_status) | Check DICOM metadata and return the corresponding status. |

### calculate_average_z_gap { #dicube.dicom.dicom_status.calculate_average_z_gap }

```python
dicom.dicom_status.calculate_average_z_gap(z_locations)
```

Calculate the average gap between Z-axis locations.

Uses a robust method to estimate the typical Z-axis interval:
1. If a single interval appears in >80% of cases, use that value
2. Otherwise, use the larger absolute value between median and mean

Args:
    z_locations: Sorted array of Z-axis locations

Returns:
    float: Estimated typical Z-axis interval; 0 if cannot be calculated

### get_dicom_status { #dicube.dicom.dicom_status.get_dicom_status }

```python
dicom.dicom_status.get_dicom_status(meta)
```

Check DICOM metadata and return the corresponding status.

Performs a series of checks on the DICOM metadata to determine its status.
Checks include:
- Series UID consistency
- Instance number sequence
- Pixel spacing uniformity
- Image dimensions
- Patient orientation
- Data type consistency
- Z-axis location sequence

Args:
    meta: DicomMeta instance providing access to DICOM metadata

Returns:
    DicomStatus: The status enum value representing the check results
